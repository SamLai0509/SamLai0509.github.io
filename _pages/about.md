I am a PhD student in Computing & Information Science at the University of Nebraska Omaha. My research focuses on developing AI-enhanced scientific compression and ROI-aware data reduction frameworks to optimize large-scale HPC simulations.
I am particularly interested in advancing physics-informed machine learning architectures. Previously, I developed a deep convolutional denoiser for the GRAND experiment, which suppressed Galactic backgrounds and achieved a median output-SNR gain of 15-23 dB.
